    Reliability is (obviously) a big part of racing, as such it also plays an important role in SimTECH.

<MudText>
    Whether a driver had a reliability failure is checked once every advance, ergo this is checked quite frequently. There are three different
    reliability checks, these are based on: driver, car and engine. These are not considered simultanously during every advance, instead it will
    be cycled which reliablity category will be rolled for the current advance. Like this: 'driver' -> 'car' -> 'engine' -> 'driver' -> etc...

<MudText>
    One exception, in the first advance of a race the reliability of a driver will be checked one additional time. This represents the crashes
    first laps tend to cause in motorsport.

<MudText>
    If a driver suffers from a reliablity failure, one additional roll will be done to see if the DNF in question is actually going to result in
    a heavy crash where the driver either suffers from an injury or dies altogether. Which depends on whatever you would like it to be.
