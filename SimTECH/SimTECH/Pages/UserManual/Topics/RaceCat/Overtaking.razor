<MudText>
    Overtaking is done by racing drivers, usually.
    <br />
    Attack minus Defensive, if result is negative then subtract that from attackers total.
    <br />
    Battle RNG exists. The configureable number accounts for both the minimal negative and maximal positive, in other words when the Battle RNg
    is 10, then the RNG-range will be from -10 to +10. This is assigned both to every attacking and defending value (for every indivdiual overtake).
    <br />
    There are situations where overtakes will happen in an instant, for now this is limited to when the defender either DNFs or made a pitstop.
    Mistakes meanwhile halves the value of an attacker or defender (which more often than not is going to be just the defender).

    Attack and Defense stats for overtaking. Kind of like one of those DnD games, where if a car behind has a score higher than the car ahead,
    they have to do like an Attack-Defense check to see how much time they lose/if they get past.

    Basically I think it’d go something like this: A track has a natural “Defense” boost (overtaking difficulty) added on to a driver’s
    Defense stat while they’re trying to defend from an overtaking attempt. The Attacker has their own stat,
    plus a boost from how many points ahead they are at the moment. Blah blah blah, some RNG, Attack - Defense,
    if it’s positive the attacker goes through, negative and that’s the score that’s subtracted.
    Even if the result is negative, the attacker could still get past.

    I imagine car stats would play into this too, and this could also help establish a lapping slower cars system,
    where the backmarker doesn’t put up a fight, but still has the track’s natural Defense on their side.
