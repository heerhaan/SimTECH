        Distances are incredibly important for the frame of reference when running a race, as does it play a vital role for determining how much
        is calculated every race. So, how does it work?<br />
        In reality it's very simple, for every season (or at specific races) it is defined how long the race is in kilometers. Let's take 300km for
        this. Calculation distance meanwhile is a configureable setting which by default is set at 10, this refers to the distance completed when
        advancing a race. In other words, if we have a race of 300km long and the calculation distance is set at 10 then this race will have 30
        advancements to go through before it is finished. Were we to change the calculation distance to 3 then we would have 100 advances.<br />
