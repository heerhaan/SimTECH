    Overtaking is done by racing drivers, usually.
    <br />
    Attack minus Defensive, if result is negative then subtract that from attackers total.

    Attack and Defense stats for overtaking. Kind of like one of those DnD games, where if a car behind has a score higher than the car ahead,
    they have to do like an Attack-Defense check to see how much time they lose/if they get past.
    
    Basically I think it’d go something like this: A track has a natural “Defense” boost (overtaking difficulty) added on to a driver’s
    Defense stat while they’re trying to defend from an overtaking attempt. The Attacker has their own stat,
    plus a boost from how many points ahead they are at the moment. Blah blah blah, some RNG, Attack - Defense,
    if it’s positive the attacker goes through, negative and that’s the score that’s subtracted.
    Even if the result is negative, the attacker could still get past.

    I imagine car stats would play into this too, and this could also help establish a lapping slower cars system,
    where the backmarker doesn’t put up a fight, but still has the track’s natural Defense on their side.
