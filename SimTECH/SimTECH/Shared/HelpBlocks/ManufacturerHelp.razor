    Tyre suppliers represent the different manufacturers which may exist for the used racing tyres.
    How these are different from each other, depends on the values which the user (aka: you) enters for each manufacturer.

<MudText Typo="Typo.subtitle2">Wear</MudText>
<MudText>
    The additional minimum and maximum the race tyres get, this is additive to the wear of the tyre itself.
    Field supports negative numbers as an input value.
    Keep in mind that wear is subtracted from the remaining tyre life, thus a negative value means the tyre uses LESS wear.
