# SimTECH
An application in where one can run motorsport simulations, a very useful and fun activity.
Idea of the project: simple simulation of motorsport championships, based on motorsport simulation done in Excel by FrankyDoodle.

## Reguirements
With a shared .exe release file, one should immediatly be able to run it. Altough there might still be a dependency on SQL Server.
Note: this is still very much in development so there are no actual releases yet.

## Setup
Probably something with the appsettings.json.

## Guide
Can be found in-app.
